# UI_demo_project
UI that can easily display information scraped from imdb

To run this program run python3 Application.py from terminal.

You need pyqt5 for it to work

If you don't have any data, or call it with the argument scrape, it will scrape imdb for more data.  This can take a while.  If you accidentally deleted the data, and don't want
to take the time to scrape more, call python3 load_backup.py to restore the data.
